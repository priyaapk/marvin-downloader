Marvin is a lightweight download assistant designed to be featureful, extensible (protocols and features) and fully integrated into the android OS. In its basic form it can help you download files from simple http urls in a web browser, but with its planned plug-in architecture, it can support many more protocols and download sources. As it is now, Marvin only does simple http downloading via an inputted URL, but eventually it will support many features of a fully fledged download assistant, while still maintaining a low process overhead.
