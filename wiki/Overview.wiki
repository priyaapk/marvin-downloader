= Introduction =

*Marvin* is a download assistant coded for the android OS. It was written out of a lack of a good, efficient downloader with basic features available. *Marvin* hopes to fill this gap.


= Details =

== Basic Features ==
In its most basic form, *Marvin* will be able to:
  * Be used as a standalone program with an interface to allow you to either paster URLs from the clibpoard, import from a file, type in manually. Obviously this is not ideal, so it will provide integration into web applications such as a web browser. Another planned feature is clipboard monitoring of copied links.
  * HTTP Authentication
  * HTTP Download Resume

== Planned Features ==
  * File Hoster support
  * Plug-in architecture for features and protocols
  * Bittorrent Support
  * RSS parsing
  * Many Others
